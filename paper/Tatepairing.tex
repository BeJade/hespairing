\section{The reduced Tate pairing}

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a finite field $\FF_{p}$ where $p$ is a prime, and let $r$ be the size of the largest prime-order subgroup of $E(\FF_{p})$. We define the \emph{embedding degree} of $E$ to be
\[\text{min}\{k \in \mathbb{Z}: r|p^{k}-1\}.\]
For an integer $0<d\leq k$ and a point $T \in E(\FF_{p^{d}})$, we define the function $f_{r,T}$ to be the unique normalized function such that
\[\text{div}(f_{r,T}) = r[T]-[rT]-(r-1)[T_{\infty}],\] where $T_{\infty}$ denotes the point at infinity on $E$.
\begin{definition}
Let $E$, $p$, $k$, $r$, and for $P \in E(\FF_{p})$, the function $f_{r,P}$ be as above. We define the \emph{reduced Tate pairing on $E$} to be
\[\begin{array}{rccc}
e_{r}:& E(\FF_{p})\times E(\FF_{p^{k}}) & \longrightarrow & \FF_{p^{k}} \\
& (P,Q) & \mapsto & f_{r,P}(Q)^{\frac{q^{k}-1}{r}}.
\end{array}\]
\end{definition} 
If $E$ is ordinary, then this is a non-degenerate bilinear pairing, as shown in e.g. \cite{Hess}. Furthermore, the following facts, due to Miller (\cite{Mil}), allow us to explicitly compute this pairing. Let $0<d \leq k$ be an integer, and let $T,T' \in E(\FF_{q^{d}})$. We will write $L_{T,T'}$ for the projective line passing through $T$ and $T'$, and we will write $g_{T,T'}$ for the function
\[g_{T,T'}= \frac{L_{T,T'}}{L_{T+T',-(T+T')}}.\]

\begin{lemma}
With notation as above, for $P\in E(\FF_{p})$, we have that $f_{0,P} = f_{1,P}=1$ and for $n \geq 2$, that $f_{n+1,P} = f_{n,P}g_{P,nP}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Straightforward computation on divisors. See \cite{Mil} for more details.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
With notation as above, for $P \in E(\FF_{p})$ and $Q \in E(\FF_{p^{k}})$, we get that
\[e_{r}(P,Q)= \prod_{m=1}^{r-1} \frac{L_{P,mP}(Q)^{\frac{p^{k}-1}{r}}}{L_{(m+1)P,-(m+1)P}(Q)^{\frac{p^{k}-1}{r}}}.\]
\end{corollary}

Hence, we only need to give formulae for addition and point doubling to compute the reduced Tate pairing.
