Abstract: 	This paper recalls explicit constructions of families of pairing-friendly twisted Hessian curves with embedding degree $k \equiv 3,9,15 \pmod{18}$ and $k \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ where $18 \nmid k$ and gives explicit formulas to compute the reduced Tate pairing on these families of twisted Hessian curves. Curves generated by our constructions are guaranteed to have twists of degree 3. We also explain a method to eliminate denominators for odd embedding degrees. Our constructions provide alternative embedding degrees for a higher security level in view of the recent attacks on the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curves over finite fields with composite embedding degree.
