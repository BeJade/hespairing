\section{Discussion and future work}

% ours is for TWISTED Hessian curves
% which is more general than Gu, Gu and Xie which is only Hessian curves
% our formulas are also faster than them

Although pairing on Hessian curves has already been considered, for example, by Gu, Gu, and Xie in~\cite{2010/Gu} and by Li and Zhang in~\cite{2012/Li},
this work appears to be the first to explain methods to generate pairing-friendly Hessian curves.
%Our constructions allow curves with twsits of degree $3$.
Moreover, we applied state-of-the-art point arithmetic formulas from~\cite{2015/hessian}
and present faster formulas for line function and pairing computations.

Our initial analysis shows that the speed of line function computations on Hessian curves
is comparable to those on Weierstrass curves.
However, Hessian curves have an advantage of faster point arithmetic,
which may lead to faster overall performance of pairing computations.
%In constrast to the widely used Weierstrass curves,
%Hessian curves provide faster point arithmetic formulas.
%With our constructions of pairing-friendly Hessian curves
%together with all presented techniques related to pairing computations on Hessian curves,
We expect pairing on Hessian curves to be faster than on Weierstrass curves and
consider the optimized implementation as future work.
