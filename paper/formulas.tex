\section{Computation of line functions}

The heart of pairings lies on the computation of line functions.
A rational function $f_{r,P}$ associated to the point $P$ and some integer $r$
is first constructed.
Then, this function is evaluated at the point $Q$.
The divisor associated to the function $f_{,P}$ is
$$ div(f_{r,P}) = r(P) - (rP) - (r-1)(P_\infty). $$
Miller's algorithm computes $f_{r,P}$ in the double-and-add manner
and uses the following relation
$$ f_{i+j,P} = f_{i,P} f_{j,P} \frac{l_1}{l_2}, $$
where $l_1$ is a line through $iP$ and $jP$,
and $l_2$ is a line through $(i+j)P$ and $-(i+j)P$.

Constructing the line $l_1$ can be done by substituting $x$ and $y$ coordinates of points $iP$ and $jP$
into an equation $y = mx + b$ and solving for $m$ and $b$.
For Weierstrass curves, the line $l_2$ is simply a vertical line through $(i+j)P$.
Therefor, the line $l_2$ is of the form $x = c$ where $c$ is the $x$-coordinate of the point $(i+j)P$.
Note that the point $(i+j)P$ and $-(i+j)P$ have the same $x$-coordinate.
However, for Hessian curves, the line $l_2$ is not a vertical line
and thus has to be constructed in a similar way as the line $l_1$,
i.e., solving for $m$ and $b$ of $y = mx + b$ using points $(i+j)P$ and $-(i+j)P$.

Let $m = (m_{\ell-1}, \dots, m_1, m_0)$ be the binary representation of $m$.
Initialize $R = P$ and $f = 1$.
Algorithm~\ref{algo:miller} shows Miller's algorithm.

\subsection{Denominator elimination}
We follow a similar technique as described in~\cite{2008/lin} and~\cite{2009/deg15}
by rewriting an inversion into a fraction having denominator lies in a subfield.
Define a finite field extension $\F{q^k}$ of a finite field $\F{q}$,
element $x,y \in \F{q^k}$.

%Observe that
%$$ \frac{1}{a} = \frac{a^q \cdot a^{q^2}} {a \cdot a^{q} \cdot a^{q^2}} $$
%where $a \cdot a^{q} \cdot a^{q^2} = N(a)$, i.e., a $norm$ of $a$ which lies in $\F{q}$.
%Because $N(a) \in \F{q}$ which is a subfield of $\F{q^m}$,
%the final exponentiation forces $N(a)$ to become 1.
%This means that we can ignore the computation of the denominator $N(a)$.
%Therefore, instead of computing $\frac{1}{a}$,
%we compute $a^{q} \cdot a^{q^2}$ where
%$a^{q}$ and $a^{q^2}$ can be easily computed using Frobenius.

Observe that
$$ \frac{1}{x-y} = \frac{x^2 + xy + y^2}{x^3 - y^3}. $$
Because $x^3$ and $y^3$ lie in a subfield of $\F{q^k}$ and so as $x^3 - y^3$,
the final exponentiation forces $x^3 - y^3$ to become 1.
This means that we can ignore the computation of the denominator $x^3 - y^3$.
Therefore, instead of computing $\frac{1}{x-y}$,
we compute $x^2 + xy + y^2$
and the cost of division by $x - y$ beceomes the cost of multiplication by $x^2 + xy + y^2$.

\subsection{Explicit formulas}

Recall the twsited Hessian curve equation in projective coordiates
%$ a x^3 + y^3 = 1 + d x y, $ or
$$ \mathcal{H}: a X^3 + Y^3 = Z^3 + d X Y Z. $$
This subsection shows formulas to compute point doubling, point addition, and line functions associated to these operations.
These formulas work under an assumption that the curve parameter $d = 0$.

Symbols $\mul, \sqr, \mulp{a}, \mulp{b}, k, d$ denote
field multiplication,
field squaring,
field multiplication by curve constant $a$,
field multiplication by curve constant $b$
embedding degree and
twist degree respectively.

\subsubsection{Doubling.}
%	// 5M + 2S + 3*3 + 1*2 + 1*neg + 6*add
%	// assume d = 0
Given a point $P = (X_1,Y_1,Z_1)$ on $E/\F{p}$ and a point $Q = (X_Q,Y_Q,1)$ on $E'/\F{p^{k/d}}$,
the following formulas compute the doubling of point $P = 2P = (X_3,Y_3,Z_3)$ and the line function $l$.
\begin{align*}
T &= Y_1^2;\	\qquad	A = Y_1 \cdot T;\	\qquad
S = Z_1 ^ 2;\	\qquad	B = Z_1 \cdot S;\\
X_3 &= X_1 \cdot (A - B);\	\quad
Y_3 = -Z_1 \cdot (2A + B);\	\quad
Z_3 = Y_1 \cdot (A + 2B);\\
l_1 &= a X_1^2 X_Q + T \cdot Y_Q + S;\	\qquad
l_a = X_3 \cdot Q_Y + X_3;	\\
l_b &= X_Q \cdot (Y_3 + Z_3);\			\qquad
l_c = (l_a^2 + l_a \cdot l_b + l_b^2);\		\qquad
l = l_1 \cdot l_c;
\end{align*}
The total number of operations is
$ k(2\mul + \frac{2}{3}\sqr) + 5\mul +3\sqr + 1\mul_a$.

\subsubsection{Addition.}
Given points $P = (X_1,Y_1,1)$ and $R = (X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$ on $E/\F{p}$ and a point $Q = (X_Q,Y_Q,1)$ on $E'/\F{p^{k/d}}$,
the following formulas compute the addition of points $P + R = (X_1,Y_1,Z_1) + (X_2,Y_2,Z_2) = (X_3,Y_3,Z_3)$ and the line function $l$.
\begin{align*}
A &= X_1 \cdot Z_2;\	\qquad
C = Y_1 \cdot X_2;\	\qquad
D = Y_1 \cdot Y_2;\	\qquad
F = a X_1 \cdot X_2;\\
G &= (D + Z_2) \cdot (A - C);\	\quad
H = (D - Z_2) \cdot (A + C);\\
J &= (D + F) \cdot (A - Y_2);\	\quad
K = (D - F) \cdot (A + Y_2);\\
X_3 &= G - H;\	\qquad
Y_3 = K - J;\\
Z_3 &= J + K - G - H - 2(B - F) \cdot (C + E);\\
l_1 &= (Y_1 \cdot Z_2 - Y_2) \cdot (X_1 - X_Q) + (Y_Q - Y_1) \cdot (X_1 \cdot Z_2 - X_2);\\
l_a &= Y_Q \cdot X_3 + X_3;\	\quad
l_b = X_Y \cdot (Y_3 + Z_3);\	\quad
l_c = (l_a^2 + l_a \cdot l_b + l_b^2);\\
l &= l_1 \cdot \l_c;
\end{align*}
The total number of operations is
$ k(2\mul + \frac{2}{3}\sqr) + 11\mul + 1\mul_a$.
