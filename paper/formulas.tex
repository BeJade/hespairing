\section{Explicit formulas}
\label{sec:formulas}

Recall the twisted Hessian curve equation in projective coordinates
$$ \mathcal{H}: a' X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 = d' X Y Z. $$
This section shows formulas for computing point doubling, point addition,
and line functions associated to these operations.
These formulas work under an assumption that the curve parameter $d' = 0$.

We denote operations in the base field, namely, 
field multiplication, field squaring and field multiplication by the curve parameter $a'$
by $\mul, \sqr, \mulp{a}$ respectively.
We denote the embedding degree by $k$ and the twist degree by $d=3$.

The following formulas work for both Tate and ate pairings.
We denote a point $P = (X_1,Y_1,1)$ and a point $R = (X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$ on $E/\F{q}$
and a point $Q = (X_{Q},Y_{Q},1)$ on $E/\F{q^{k}}$ where $Y_Q \in \F{q^{k/d}}$.
Note the points $P$ and $Q$ do not change throughout the pairing computation and thus can be preprocessed,
namely, we assume that the $X_1 = Z_{Q} = 1$.

\subsection{Doubling}
First, we show formulas for point doubling.
These formulas work under the condition that the curve parameter $d'=0$,
which is the case for pairing-friendly twisted Hessian generated by our constructions.
Let $R = (X_1, Y_1, Z_1)$.
The following formulas compute the doubling of a point $R = 2R = (X_3,Y_3,Z_3)$.
\begin{align*}
T &= Y_1^2;\	\qquad	A = Y_1 \cdot T;\	\qquad
S = Z_1 ^ 2;\	\qquad	B = Z_1 \cdot S;\\
X_3 &= X_1 \cdot (A - B);\	\quad
Y_3 = -Z_1 \cdot (2A + B);\	\quad
Z_3 = Y_1 \cdot (A + 2B).
\end{align*}
The above formulas for computing point doubling
cost $5\mul + 2\sqr$. % + 2\mulp{2} + 3\add$ plus one negation.

Let $Q = (X_{Q}, Y_{Q}, 1)$ be the point at which we evaluate.
Let $R$ and $2R$ be as defined above for point doubling.
The associated line function for doubling
to compute $l_{2R}(Q)$ is as follows
\begin{align*}
l_1 &= a X_1^2 X_{Q} + T \cdot Y_{Q} + S;\		\qquad
l_a = X_3 \cdot Y_{Q} + X_3;			\\
l_b &= X_{Q} \cdot (Y_3 + Z_3);\			\qquad
l_c = l_a^2 + l_b \cdot (l_a + l_b);\		\qquad
l = l_1 \cdot l_c.
\end{align*}
To compute the line function for doubling,
it costs 
%$\frac{k}{3}(6\mul + \sqr) + \sqr + \mulp{a}$.
$k(\frac{14}{3}\mul + \frac{1}{3}\sqr) + \sqr + \mul_a$.
Therefore, the total number of operations for the ``doubling step''
({line 3} in Algorithm~\ref{algo:miller}) in the pairing computation is
%$\frac{k}{3}(6\mul + \sqr) + 5\mul +3\sqr + \mulp{a}$.
$k(\frac{14}{3}\mul + \frac{1}{3}\sqr) + 5\mul +3\sqr + \mul_a$.

\subsection{Addition}
Let $P = (X_1,Y_1,1)$ and $R = (X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$.
The following formulas compute the addition of points
$P + R = (X_1,Y_1,1) + (X_2,Y_2,Z_2) = (X_3,Y_3,Z_3)$.
\begin{align*}
A &= X_1 \cdot Z_2;\	\qquad
C = Y_1 \cdot X_2;\	\qquad
D = Y_1 \cdot Y_2;\	\qquad
F = a X_1 \cdot X_2;\\
G &= (D + Z_2) \cdot (A - C);\	\quad
H = (D - Z_2) \cdot (A + C);\\
J &= (D + F) \cdot (A - Y_2);\	\quad
K = (D - F) \cdot (A + Y_2);\\
X_3 &= G - H;\	\qquad
Y_3 = K - J;\\
Z_3 &= J + K - G - H - 2(Z_2 - F) \cdot (C + Y_2).
\end{align*}
The above formulas for computing point addition
cost $9\mul + \mulp{a}$.

Let $Q = (X_{Q},Y_{Q},1)$ be the point at which we evaluate.
Let $P,R,(P+R)$ be as defined above for point addition.
The associated line function for addition
to compute $l_{R,P}$ is as follows
\begin{align*}
l_1 &= (Y_1 \cdot Z_2 - Y_2) \cdot (X_1 - X_{Q}) + (Y_{Q} - Y_1) \cdot (X_1 \cdot Z_2 - X_2);\\
l_a &= Y_{Q} \cdot X_3 + X_3;\	\quad
l_b = X_{Q} \cdot (Y_3 + Z_3);\	\quad
l_c = l_a^2 + l_a \cdot (l_b + l_b);\\
l &= l_1 \cdot \l_c.
\end{align*}
To compute the line function for addition,
it costs
%$\frac{k}{3}(6\mul + \sqr) + 2\mul$.
$k(\frac{14}{3}\mul + \frac{1}{3}\sqr) + 2\mul$.
Therefore, the total number of operations for the ``addition step''
({line 6} in Algorithm~\ref{algo:miller}) in the pairing computation is
%$\frac{k}{3}(6\mul + \sqr) + 11\mul + \mulp{a}$.
$k(\frac{14}{3}\mul + \frac{1}{3}\sqr) + 11\mul + \mul_a$.
