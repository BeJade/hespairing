Abstract:
This paper introduces concrete constructions of families of pairing-friendly
twisted Hessian curves with embedding degree $k \equiv 3,9,15 \pmod{18}$ and
$k \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ where $18 \nmid k$.  This paper also provides explicit
formulas to compute the optimal ate pairing on these families of twisted
Hessian curves.  Curves generated by our constructions are guaranteed to have
twists of degree 3.  We also explain a method to eliminate denominators for
odd embedding degrees.  Our constructions provide alternative embedding
degrees for a better adjustment of the base field and the embedding degree in
view of the recent attacks on the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic
curves over finite fields with composite embedding degree.
