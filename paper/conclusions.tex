% ours is for TWISTED Hessian curves
% which is more general than Gu, Gu and Xie which is only Hessian curves
% our formulas are also faster than them

This paper presents concrete methods to generate pairing-friendly twisted Hessian curves.
Curves generated by these methods guarantee to have twists of degree $3$ and
have embedding degree
$k \equiv 3 \pmod{18}$,
$k \equiv 9,15 \pmod{18}$ or
$k \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ where $18 \nmid k$.
We describe techniques to eliminate intermediate denominators for odd embedding degrees
which results in removing all division operations and hence leads to faster overall computation.
We also provide explicit formulas to compute line functions in pairing computations.
%Our constructions of pairing-friendly twsited Hessian curves together with presented techniques and formulas
%offer fast point arithmetic and fast line function computations
%competitive with pairing-friendly Weierstrass and Edwards curves.

Although pairing on Hessian curves has already been considered,
for example, by Gu, Gu, and Xie in~\cite{2010/Gu} and by Li and Zhang in~\cite{2012/Li},
this work appears to be the first to explain methods to generate pairing-friendly ``twisted'' Hessian curves.
We would like to emphasize that curves considered in~\cite{2010/Gu} are Hessian curves
while our curves are ``twisted'' Hessian curves, a generalization of Hessian curves.
This means that our presented formulas can be applied to more curves.
Our constructions allow curves with twists of degree $3$.
Moreover, we applied state-of-the-art fast point arithmetic formulas from~\cite{2015/hessian}.
%and present faster formulas for line function and pairing computations.

This work also appears to be the first that considers pairings on curve models other than Weierstrass with odd embedding degrees.
One of our constructions generates pairing-friendly twisted Hessian curves having embedding degree 15.
We expect that this embedding degree 15 helps narrowing a gap of embedding degree 12 and 18
which are used in famous pairing-friendly curve BN, BLS and KSS families.
The advance in solving DLP makes it necessary to increase the prime field size and/or the embedding degrees.
Our embedding degree 15 provides a better adjustment of the field size,
i.e., by using embedding degree 15 instead of 18, the field size could be smaller.

%Our initial analysis shows that the speed of line function computations on Hessian curves
%is comparable to those on Weierstrass curves.
%However, Hessian curves have an advantage of faster point arithmetic,
%which may lead to faster overall performance of pairing computations.
%%In constrast to the widely used Weierstrass curves,
%%Hessian curves provide faster point arithmetic formulas.
%%With our constructions of pairing-friendly Hessian curves
%%together with all presented techniques related to pairing computations on Hessian curves,
%We expect pairing on Hessian curves to be faster than on Weierstrass curves and
%consider the optimized implementation as future work.
