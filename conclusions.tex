\section{Conclusions}

This paper presents concrete methods to generate pairing-friendly Hessian curves.
Curves generated by these methods have twists of degree $3$ and
have embedding degree
$k \equiv 3 \pmod{18}$,
$k \equiv 9,15 \pmod{18}$ or
$k \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ where $18 \nmid k$.
We describe techniques to eliminate intermediate denominators by using Frobenius,
which results in removing all division operations and hence leads to faster overall computation.
We also provide explicit formulas to compute line functions in pairing computations.
Our constructions of pairing-friendly Hessian curves together with presented techniques and formulas
offer fast point arithmetic and fast line function computations
competitive with pairing-friendly Weierstrass and Edwards curves.
